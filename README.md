# An importer/exporter

“Well, what does he do?”\
“He’s an importer.”\
“Just imports, no exports?”\
“He’s an importer/exporter, okay?”\
“So, what does he, uh, import?”\
”Uh… mainly JavaScript”.\
”What kind of JavaScript?”\
”The typed one.”\
”And what does he export?”\
”HTML, CSS, some components, more TypeScript… and references to comedy series from the 90s.[^1]”\
”I’m sorry for bothering you.”
